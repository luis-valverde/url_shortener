## Introduction

Spice up your life with your very own URL shortener! You may have used or created links via
services like bit.ly before. The goal is to turn a potentially long URL into a much shorter one,
for ease of use. Now it's time to make your own.

## Requirements

Create the necessary APIs to satisfy the following:

1. Receive a URL and return a unique short-form URL for an specific domain.
2. Receive a short URL and return the original long URL.
3. Be fairly certain that these functions work as expected.

**Bonus**: Count the number of times each short URL was "visited", that is, resolved back to
return the original, as per point 2 above.
